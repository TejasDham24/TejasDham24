## 🚀 Projects

### Anemia Prevalence and Risk Factors Among Children (6–59 Months) in India  
*Jan 2024 – Apr 2024*

In this project, I analyzed large-scale data to understand how widespread anemia is among young children in India and what factors contribute to it. The analysis showed that nearly **69%** of children in this age group are affected. I applied machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and identify key health-related risk factors.

**Skills used:** EDA, Big Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning

### Impact of Automobile Components on Price  
*Feb 2022 – Apr 2022*

This project focused on understanding how different automobile features influence pricing. The results showed that engine displacement, fuel type, body style, and the number of airbags play a major role in determining a car’s price. I built a regression model to predict prices and help identify economical and comfortable vehicle options.

**Skills used:** Statistical Analysis, Regression, Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing
